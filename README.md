# HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor-
## User Story

```
AS A bootcamp student
I WANT to refactor a code that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT the user site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


What was your motivation? My notivation for this code was to learn how there is always room for improvement even when someone has been writing code for years. A starting developer also has skills to offer. I also learned about the scout rule and this assignment was great practice to learn how to adhere to that rule.

Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I completed this assignment to learn how to apply the scout rule.

What problem does it solve? The code has no accessibility attributes for any of the images. I was able to add the alt attrribute and understand its importance.

What did you learn? I learned about the importance of the Scout Rule, alt attribute, and how you can always go back to your code to clean it up and make it a little more organized.

What makes your project stand out? I am not sure that my project stands out, but I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to learn and become a great coder who adheres to the scout rule!
